Workflow:
results = anova() # get table for all effects and detect interactions
plot(results)     # assess whether interactions are trivial or large

# if interactions are trivial, can immediately do posthoc test of choice on the independent main effects
tukey(results)

# if interactions are nontrivial, do subanovas with one less factor, at each level of the removed factor, with Î±/k for k levels
subanova(results)

# finally, do pairwise (e.g. tukey) tests among levels of one factor
tukey(results, [1,2])
