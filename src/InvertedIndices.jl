    InvertedIndex(idx)
    Not(idx)

Construct an inverted index, selecting all indices not in the passed `idx`.

Upon indexing into an array, the `InvertedIndex` behaves like a 1-dimensional
collection of the indices of the array that are not in `idx`. Bounds are
checked to ensure that all indices in `idx` are within the bounds of the array
â€” even though they are skipped. The `InvertedIndex` behaves like a
1-dimensional collection of its inverted indices. If `idx` spans multiple
dimensions (like a multidimensional logical mask or `CartesianIndex`), then the
inverted index will similarly span multiple dimensions.
