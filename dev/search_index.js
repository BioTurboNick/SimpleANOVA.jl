For the array, each dimension is a factor level, such that observations[2,5,3] indicates the 2nd level of the first factor, the 5th level of the second factor, and the 3rd level of the third factor. May contain values or vectors of values, where the vector contains replicates. Factors should be ordered with least significant first.

Provide this when observations is given as a vector. Factor levels do not have to be consecutive or ordered. Nested factors must reuse factor levels currently.\nfactortypes: Vector indicating the FactorType for each factor. Factors must be ordered with nested first, then random/measured or fixed/manipulated in any order. For repeated measures, subject or block must appear after within-subject fixed and before among-subject fixed. If too few values are provided, remaining are assumed to be fixed.\nfactornames: Vector of names for each factor, excluding the replicate factor. If empty, will be automatically populated alphabetically.\nhasreplicates: Boolean to specify if the first level should be considered \n\nNotes: The last index will be the top factor in the table.\n\nOutput: AnovaData structure containing the test results for each factor.\n\nExamples\n\nanova(observations)                           # N-way fixed-effects ANOVA with replicates (vectors or first dimension)\nanova(observations, hasreplicates = false)    # N-way fixed-effects ANOVA without replicates (first dimension)\nanova(observations, [random])                 # N-way ANOVA with lower random factor and 1 or 2 upper fixed factors\nanova(observations, [random])                 # N-way ANOVA with lower random factor and 1 or 2 upper fixed factors\nanova(observations, [fixed, random])          # N-way ANOVA with 1 lower fixed factor, 1 random factor, and 0 or 1 upper fixed factor\nanova(observations, [nested, random])         # N-way fixed-effects ANOVA with 1 random nested factor, 1 random factor, and 1-2 fixed factors\nanova(observations, [fixed, subject])         # N-way repeated measures ANOVA with 1 within-subjects fixed factor\nanova(observations, [fixed, block])           # N-way repeated measures ANOVA with 1 within-block fixed factor\nanova(observations, [nested, fixed, subject]) # N-way repeated measures ANOVA with 1 within-subjects fixed factor and 1 nested factor\n\nGlossary\n\nobservation: The dependent variable.\nfactor: An independent variable.\nfactor level: A value of a factor.\nbalanced: All combinations of factor levels have the same number of observations.\ncrossed factor: A factor with levels that combine with the levels of all other crossed factors.\nfixed/manipulated factor: A factor with fixed effects (e.g. treatment, concentration, exposure time).\nrandom/measured factor: A factor with random effects (e.g. location, individual).\nnested factor: A random factor where the levels are unique to a combination of crossed factor levels (e.g. replicate).\nsubject/block factor: A nested factor that is subjected to multiple levels of another factor.\nsum of squares (SS): A measure of variance that is dependent on sample size. Also called \"sum of squared deviations.\"\ndegrees of freedom (DF, ν): The number of bins in which the values could have been moved, if random.\nmean square (MS): SS / DF. Corrects for the larger variance expected if random values can be assigned to more bins. Also called \"mean squared error\" or \"mean squared deviation.\"\nF-statistic: The division of MS values produce a result belonging to the \"F distribution\", the shape of which depends on the DF of the numerator and error. The location of this value on the distribution provides the p-value.\np-value: The probability that, if all measurements had been drawn from the same population, you would obtain data at least as extreme as contained in your observations.\neffect size (ω²): The standardized difference in the measurement caused by the factor. This is the generalized version which is largely stable with respect to study design.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api/#SimpleANOVA.contrast","page":"API","title":"SimpleANOVA.contrast","text":"contrast(anovaresult::AnovaResult, groupassignment::Vector{Int})\n\nCalculate a single-factor contrast against the groups specified in groupassignment.
